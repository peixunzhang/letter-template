My name is Peixun Zhang, I'm currently a master's student in Computer Science with Data Analytics.
About one year ago, I started to teach myself programming.
I began by learning Python and have done several courses in addition to my
university curriculum since then. I discovered that I enjoy functional programming
and continued my studies by taking scala courses.

So far, I know core language features and data structures.
I'm confident that I will pick up any libraries that are useful for my day-to-day work quickly.

I'm applying for this role because I'm very eager to gain more practical experience and am looking
forward to seeing how Scala is used in big projects. MOIA has a great team of experienced developers
and I believe that this would be the perfect environment to transform my
knowledge into skills that are valuable in the future.

\closing{I'm looking forward to hearing from you,}
